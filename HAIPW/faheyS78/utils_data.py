Antifa Denied Permit to Protest on Campus, Provoking Debate About "Cancel Culture"

Columbus, OH

A debate on the merits of free speech erupted recently when the student chapter of the
controversial far-left group Antifa attempted to obtain a permit to conduct a demonstration
on the main quad of Rutgers University in New Jersey.

Citing safety concerns, the president of the organization in charge of Registered Student
Organizations (RSOs) initially denied the organization the right to conduct their rally,
arguing that their presence would endanger college students.

They cited a recent incident in Berkeley, CA where three Antifa members and two bystanders
were injured by rocks thrown in an altercation between the group and counter protesters.

A member of the local Antifa group, Luke Vargas, is appealing the decision, arguing that
the permit denial represented "cancel culture run amok," and the University was simply
"afraid to hear the truth."

When asked to comment, the University Ombudsman's Office promised that a final decision
on whether the rally would be permitted would be made by this Thursday, three days before
the march is scheduled to take place on Sunday.
